# DirectXTex texture processing library

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248926

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

**October 28, 2023**

This package contains DirectXTex, a shared source library for reading and writing ``.DDS`` files, and performing various texture content processing operations including resizing, format conversion, mip-map generation, block compression for Direct3D runtime texture resources, and height-map to normal-map conversion. This library makes use of the Windows Image Component (WIC) APIs. It also includes ``.TGA`` and ``.HDR`` readers and writers since these image file formats are commonly used for texture content processing pipelines, but are not currently supported by a built-in WIC codec.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.11), Visual Studio 2022, clang for Windows v12 or later, or MinGW 12.2. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required for Visual Studio. It can also be built for Windows Subsystem for Linux using GCC 11 or later.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

## Directory Layout

* ``DirectXTex\``

  + This contains the DirectXTex library. This includes a full-featured DDS reader and writer including legacy format conversions, a TGA reader and writer, a HDR reader and writer, a WIC-based bitmap reader and writer (BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and HD Photo), and various texture processing functions. This is intended primarily for tool usage.

> The majority of the header files here are intended for internal implementation
    of the library only (``BC.h``, ``BCDirectCompute.h``, ``DDS.h``, ``DirectXTexP.h``, etc.). Only ``DirectXTex.h`` and ``DirectXTex.inl`` are meant as the 'public' header for the library.

* ``Auxiliary\``

  + Contains optional source files for the DirectXTex library, such as adapter loading functions using the OpenEXR library.

* ``Texconv\``

  + This DirectXTex sample is an implementation of the [texconv](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv) command-line texture utility from the DirectX SDK utilizing DirectXTex rather than D3DX.

    It supports the same arguments as the *Texture Conversion Tool Extended* (``texconvex.exe``) legacy DirectX SDK utility. The primary differences are the ``-10`` and ``-11`` arguments are not applicable and the filter names (``POINT``, ``LINEAR``, ``CUBIC``, ``FANT`` or ``BOX``, ``TRIANGLE``, ``*_DITHER``, ``*_DITHER_DIFFUSION``). This also includes support for the JPEG XR (HD Photo) bitmap format.

* ``Texassemble\``

  + This DirectXTex sample is a [command-line utility](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texassemble) for creating cubemaps, volume maps, or texture arrays from a set of individual input image files.

* ``Texdiag\``

  + This DirectXTex sample is a [command-line utility](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texdiag) for analyzing image contents, primarily for debugging purposes.

* ``DDSView\``

  + This DirectXTex sample is a simple Direct3D 11-based viewer for DDS files. For array textures or volume maps, the "<" and ">" keyboard keys will show different images contained in the DDS. The "1" through "0" keys can also be used to jump to a specific image index.

* ``DDSTextureLoader\``

  + This contains a streamlined version of the legacy DirectX SDK sample *DDSWithoutD3DX11* texture loading code for a simple light-weight runtime DDS loader. There are versions for Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11, and Direct3D 12. This performs no runtime pixel data conversions. This is ideal for runtime usage, and supports the full complement of Direct3D texture  resources (1D, 2D, volume maps, cubemaps, mipmap levels, texture arrays, BC formats, etc.).

* ``ScreenGrab\``

  + This contains texture writing modules for Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11, and Direct3D 12 primarily intended for creating screenshots. The images are written as a DDS or as an image file format using WIC.

* ``WICTextureLoader\``

  + This contains a Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 2D texture loader that uses WIC to load a bitmap (BMP, JPEG, PNG, HD Photo, or other WIC supported file container), resize if needed based on the current feature level (or by explicit parameter), format convert to a DXGI_FORMAT if required, and then create a 2D texture. Note this does not support 1D textures, volume textures, cubemaps, or texture arrays. DDSTextureLoader is recommended for fully "precooked" textures for maximum performance and image quality, but this loader can be useful for creating simple 2D texture from standard image files at runtime.

> DDSTextureLoader11, ScreenGrab11, and WICTextureLoader11 are 'stand-alone' versions of the same modules provided in the [DirectX Tool Kit for DX11](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK)

> DDSTextureLoader12, ScreenGrab12, and WICTextureLoader12 are 'stand-alone' versions of the same modules provided in the [DirectX Tool Kit for DX12](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK12).

* ``build\``

  + Contains YAML files for the build pipelines along with some miscellaneous build files and scripts.

## Release Notes

* Starting with the July 2022 release, the ``bool forceSRGB`` parameter for the CreateTextureEx and CreateShaderResourceViewEx functions is now a ``CREATETEX_FLAGS`` typed enum bitmask flag parameter. This may have a *breaking change* impact to client code. Replace ``true`` with ``CREATETEX_FORCE_SRGB`` and ``false`` with ``CREATETEX_DEFAULT``.

* Starting with the June 2020 release, this library makes use of typed enum bitmask flags per the recommendation of the _C++ Standard_ section *17.5.2.1.3 Bitmask types*. This is consistent with Direct3D 12's use of the ``DEFINE_ENUM_FLAG_OPERATORS`` macro. This may have *breaking change* impacts to client code:

  * You cannot pass the ``0`` literal as your flags value. Instead you must make use of the appropriate default enum value: ``CP_FLAGS_NONE``, ``DDS_FLAGS_NONE``, ``WIC_FLAGS_NONE``, ``TEX_FR_ROTATE0``, ``TEX_FILTER_DEFAULT``, ``TEX_FILTER_DEFAULT``, ``TEX_FILTER_DEFAULT``, ``CNMAP_DEFAULT``, or ``CNMAP_DEFAULT``.

  * Use the enum type instead of ``DWORD`` if building up flags values locally with bitmask operations. For example, ```DDS_FLAGS flags = DDS_FLAGS_NONE; if (...) flags |= DDS_FLAGS_EXPAND_LUMINANCE;```

  * In cases where some of the flags overlap, you can use the ``|`` to combine the relevant types: ``TEX_FILTER_FLAGS`` filter modes combine with ``WIC_FLAGS``, ``TEX_FILTER_FLAGS`` sRGB flags combine with ``TEX_PMALPHA_FLAGS`` or ``TEX_COMPRESS_FLAGS``. No other bitwise operators are defined. For example, ```WIC_FLAGS wicFlags = WIC_FLAGS_NONE | TEX_FILTER_CUBIC;```

* Due to the underlying Windows BMP WIC codec, alpha channels are not supported for 16bpp or 32bpp BMP pixel format files. The Windows 8.x and Windows 10 version of the Windows BMP WIC codec does support 32bpp pixel formats with alpha when using the ``BITMAPV5HEADER`` file header. Note the updated WIC is available on Windows 7 SP1 with [KB 2670838](https://walbourn.github.io/directx-11-1-and-windows-7-update/) installed.

* While DXGI 1.0 and DXGI 1.1 include 5:6:5 (``DXGI_FORMAT_B5G6R5_UNORM``) and 5:5:5:1 (``DXGI_FORMAT_B5G5R5A1_UNORM``) pixel format enumerations, the DirectX 10.x and 11.0 Runtimes do not support these formats for use with Direct3D. The DirectX 11.1 runtime, DXGI 1.2, and the WDDM 1.2 driver model fully support 16bpp formats (5:6:5, 5:5:5:1, and 4:4:4:4).

* WICTextureLoader cannot load ``.TGA`` or ``.HDR`` files unless the system has a 3rd party WIC codec installed. You must use the DirectXTex library for TGA/HDR file format support without relying on an add-on WIC codec.

* Loading of 96bpp floating-point TIFF files results in a corrupted image prior to Windows 8. This fix is available on Windows 7 SP1 with KB 2670838 installed.

* The UWP projects and the Win10 classic desktop project include configurations for the ARM64 platform. Building these requires installing the ARM64 toolset.

* When using clang/LLVM for the ARM64 platform, the Windows 11 SDK ([22000](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11/)) or later is required.

* The ``CompileShaders.cmd`` script must have Windows-style (CRLF) line-endings. If it is changed to Linux-style (LF) line-endings, it can fail to build all the required shaders.
